## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice semantic HTML, using tags like "article" and "section" to properly structure and segment the different parts of the component

An interesting challenge was displaying different images for the component based on the viewport size. This was effectively solved using the "picture" element with different "source" tags, each targeting a specific media query.

This was also a good chance to use SASS as a CSS preprocessor. For this project, I mainly used it for CSS minification, but I look forward to exploring more of its advanced features in future projects to further develop my skills.
